# Logika v Računalništvu - Catalan numbers project

## Overview
This repository contains Lean4 Catalan numbers project for the course "Logika v računalništvu" (Logic in computer science), made by **Jernej Jezeršek** and **Rok Filipovič**.

## Tasks
Below is a list of finished tasks included in this repository:
1. **Small tasks:**
  - Formalization of catalan numbers.
  - Formalization of plane trees.
  - Formalization of full binary trees.
  - Construction of type of full binary trees witn n nodes, not counting the leaves.
  - Definition of type of ballot sequences of length n.
2. **Large tasks:**
  - (T4) Construction of bijection list PlaneTree ∼= PlaneTree.
  - (T5) Rotating isomorphism
  - (T6) Proof that (2n choose n) is divisible by (n+1).

All the code is located in the /Catalan folder. All small tasks are gathered in the Tasks.lean file, while each large tasks has it's own seperate file.
